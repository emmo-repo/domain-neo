# NEO - Nuclear Energy Ontology
The **Nuclear Energy Ontology** (**NEO**) is a domain ontology developed under the EMMO framework for the representation of concepts in the field of nuclear energy.
It is based on commonly used standardization vocabularies, such as:

- ISO 12749 - Nuclear energy, nuclear technologies, and radiological protection
- "Construction Technologies for Nuclear Power Plants", IAEA Nuclear Energy Series, No. NP-T-2.5, IAEA, Vienna (AU), 2011
- IAEA Safety Glossary, Terminology Used in Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection, 2018 Edition.

It includes the representation of the Fukushima Daichi accident, based on the official IAEA report: "The Fukushima Daiichi accident - Technical Volume 1: Description and Context of the Accident", IAEA, Vienna (AU), 2015, STI/PUB/1710, ISBN 978–92–0–107015–9

<ins>The ontology is still in early development phase and provides only a partial cover of the nuclear engineering domain and Fukushima Daichi accident report.</ins>
